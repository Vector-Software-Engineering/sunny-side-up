### Overview

Completed for Hack Reactor in December 2022, this project was a React-based website for an e-commerce clothing retailer. Users are able to view a variety of dyanamic data across a wide range of products, including product details, user-submitted questions and answers, and ratings and reviews. 

Our team of three Hack Reactor enrollees had to follow a strict Business Requirment Document in order to design and implement this project to client specifications.
